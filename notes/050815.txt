TransABySS_norm_combined_cap3.fasta was used as the reference genome for differential expression.  Highest N50 with only 3 contigs with no reads aligned to.

Command:
	analysis.py

The TransABySS file had sequences that are smaller than 200 bp, which throws the data off.

Trinity_norm_combined_cap3.fasta was also run

TransABySS_combined_cap3 and Assembly_combined_cap3 were also run.

Assembly_combined_cap3.fasta had several sequences that were <200 bp.
